# Decisions Log

Resolved 2026-07-11 (review round 1). These supersede the corresponding
open questions in [FEASIBILITY.md](./FEASIBILITY.md) §10.

## D1 — Repo
Build proceeds in a **new dedicated repository**: **WebVDB — this repo**,
created at Phase 0 kickoff. The study docs were migrated here (as `docs/`)
from the original working branch and this is their permanent home.

## D2 — GPU traversal base
**Adopt the existing Apache-2.0 `pnanovdb.wgsl` port** (emcfarlane/
webgpu-nanovdb). Treat it as experimental: we **vendor it as a fork from
day one** (pinned commit, NOTICE preserved, our fixes applied in-tree with
a diff log) rather than depending on the upstream repo — prepared to
diverge permanently, happy to upstream fixes if the author engages.

## D3 — CPU half: pure TypeScript first, WASM as targeted escalation
Native-OpenVDB-in-WASM is **not** a hard requirement. Since the hard part
(building a valid NanoVDB tree from parsed voxels) must be hand-written in
every realistic option anyway, we write the v1 CPU path in **pure
TypeScript**: `.vdb` parsing (zlib; blosc via optional third-party codec),
NanoVDB serialization, Fp8/FpN quantization, affine transforms
(metadata-only Map edits), `.nvdb` read/write. Validated byte/value-wise
against official `nanovdb_convert` output on fixtures.
WASM becomes escalation rungs, adopted only on demonstrated need:
- **NanoVDB-only WASM** — official `createNanoGrid` as a correctness/perf
  backstop for the TS builder.
- **OpenVDB WASM** — only if resample/filter/CSG/`.vdb`-export become
  priorities; timeboxed, never a foundation.

## D4 — Targets and device creation
**Desktop-only v1**, modest asset sizes (EmberGen/Houdini-scale grids, WDAS
quarter cloud as the stretch fixture — no full Disney-scale assets).
Device pattern per Dennis's prior success: **create the `GPUDevice`
ourselves** (adapter query → our `requiredLimits`/features) **and pass it
to `WebGPURenderer` at construction**, rather than relying on renderer
option plumbing. The mobile atlas fallback stays designed-in but untargeted.

## D5 — Package names (working titles, Claude's pick)
- `nanovdb-wgsl` — renderer-agnostic WGSL traversal module + TS `.nvdb` loader
- `three-nanovdb` — TSL/three.js layer (grid wrapper, materials, compute utils)
- `vdb-web-tools` — TS-first CPU tooling (parse/build/quantize/transform), with optional WASM add-ons

## D6 — Browser-first; companion service is an interim crutch to eliminate
*(added review round 2, reframed round 3)* **The mission is these tools on
the web.** Every operation should run in the browser; the native OpenVDB
companion service (Docker image + thin CLI/HTTP wrapper, grown from the
Phase 0 fixture-bake image) exists only as an **interim crutch** for the
rare ops the browser stack can't do yet, and each of its endpoints carries
an explicit browser-successor plan:

| Server op (interim) | Browser successor (future effort) |
|---|---|
| `.vdb` export (full-fidelity) | TS `.vdb` writer — float/none/zlib first, validated by Houdini/Blender round-trip, fidelity grown until the server path is redundant |
| blosc-compressed `.vdb` input | third-party blosc-wasm codec plugged into the TS parser |
| resample / mixed-transform merge | **GPU compute resample** (WGSL sampling of the source grid at the new transform — machinery Phase 2 already builds) → TS tree rebuild |
| CSG / composites | same-transform composites are TS v2 already; general case rides the GPU-resample path |
| batch sequence conversion | Web Workers + File System Access API once single-file conversion is browser-native |

Success criterion: the service's op list shrinks release over release;
"needs the server" is treated as a bug with a roadmap entry, not a
feature. Background facts unchanged: `.vdb` writing is full-OpenVDB
territory in the native ecosystem (standalone NanoVDB writes only
`.nvdb`; picovdb is read-oriented), and OpenVDB-WASM (W2) stays
paper-only — the browser successors above are TS/WGSL, not Emscripten.
